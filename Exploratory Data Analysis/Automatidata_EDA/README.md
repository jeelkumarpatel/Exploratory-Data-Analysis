# Project Overview
The NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission has contracted with Automatidata to build a regression model that predicts taxi cab ride fares. In this part of the project, the data needs to be analyzed, explored, cleaned and structured prior to any modeling.
# Key insights from EDA
After running initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sample of the data provided by New York City TLC, it is clear that some of the data will prove an obstacle for accurate ride fare prediction. Namely, trips that have a total cost entered, but a total distance of “0.” At this point, analysis indicates these to be anomalies or outliers that need to be factored into the algorithm or removed completely.
